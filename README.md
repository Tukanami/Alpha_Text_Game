# Alpha_Text_Game
Zork type text game project I created; familiarizing myself with the concept inheritance with classes and objects, 
i created a game engine and map class that i could put my "scene's" under. Took a while to debug and get running smoothly but here it is. 
alpha_master is the final piece. The rest are the broken down pieces of code I created to make sure each individual piece ran.

Run alpha_master.py on a text editor, pycharm, powershell if you have python 3.x+ installed correctly and you will be able to play.
Have fun!

If you make any tweaks/changes and would like to collaborate, let me know!
Constantly learning and enjoying my journey with python.
