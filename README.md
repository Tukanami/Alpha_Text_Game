# Alpha_Text_Game
Zork type text game project I created; familiarizing myself with the concept inheritance with classes and objects, 
I created a game engine and map class that I could put my "scene's" under. Took a while to debug and get running smoothly but here it is. 
alpha_master.py is the final piece. The rest are the broken down pieces of code I created to make sure each individual piece ran.

The differences between skele.py and alpha_master.py are the debug changes. If there are more efficient ways of running the engine or map classes, I will update.

Run alpha_master.py on a text editor, pycharm, any terminal (correctly configured), powershell if you have python 3.x+ installed correctly and you will be able to play.
Have fun!

If you make any tweaks/changes and would like to collaborate, let me know!
Constantly learning and enjoying my journey with python.

- Post Development Notes:

1) Adding in a retry feature after each death? Loop you back to beginning opening scene instead of running the whole script again.
2) Attempted use of .lower() for input but debug led to scrapping. Perhaps attempt again?
3) Making use of if statements containing key words rather than answer == "x"
